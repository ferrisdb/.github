  **Building the future of distributed databases in Rust**
</div>

## ðŸŽ¯ Our Mission

We're building **FerrisDB**, an educational distributed database in Rust, to:

- **Learn and teach** distributed systems concepts through hands-on implementation
- **Explore Rust** for high-performance systems programming
- **Demonstrate AI-assisted development** with Claude Code
- **Share our journey** through open development and documentation

## ðŸš€ Goals

- Create a **learning resource** for students and developers interested in database internals
- Build a **production-quality codebase** that showcases Rust best practices
- Document the **entire development process** from architecture to implementation
- Foster a **community** around distributed systems education
